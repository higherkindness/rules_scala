#
# Coverage Replacements are a mapping of normal compiled artifacts to
# instrumented compiled artifacts.
#
# The intention is that the final test runner inspects the test
# classpath and replaces artifacts by any mappings found in the
# `replacements` field.
#
# Rules producing replacement artifacts should _not_ link the
# replacement files as any of the default outputs via DefaultInfo,
# JavaInfo, etc. This way, actions producing the replacement artifacts
# will be executed on an as needed basis.
#
# Coverage Replacements use a provider and a helper aspect to
# aggregate replacements files across the dependency graph.
#
# Under the hood, two providers are needed because Bazel doesn't allow
# duplicate providers. All we really want is semigroupal <> like
# behavior over `replacements` as we fold the dependency graph.
